				<h2>We succeed because we work hard to uncover the truth and the proof that will make that truth plain to a judge or jury.  We never give up.</h2>

				<p>We accept nothing at face value.  In every case, the defense has a story to tell.  The defense’s story involves blaming others, including the victim.  We didn’t manufacture the faulty part, they say.  Or, we didn’t promise to honor the contract.  Or, the victim did something wrong.</p>

				<p>We are known for taking cases to trial and winning.  That is important for the client who wants his day in court.  But it is also important for the client who wants to settle out of court.  Because of our record of success and our willingness to try cases, defendants are more likely to offer our client an out-of-court settlement that is fair.</p>

				<p>We think that our Representative Cases show that, no matter what the specific situation, we find out what really happened so that we can tell our client’s story accurately and effectively.</p>

						<span>Pedestrian Accident</span>
						
						<span>Chandler V. State of California</span>
						
					</div><!-- cr_single_meta -->
					
					<p>Chris Chandler, age 62, was struck by a car and killed while crossing a state highway. The police blamed Chris for riding his bicycle into oncoming traffic without first looking to make sure the road was clear and investigated the accident as a possible suicide.</p>
						
						<p>We determined that Chris was in a marked crosswalk when he was struck. We found witnesses who told us that, contrary to the police report, Chris was walking his bike when he was killed, not riding it. We uncovered documents in the state’s files showing that the crosswalk was unsafe because the pedestrian’s view of oncoming traffic could be blocked by yielding vehicles. The state refused to fix the crosswalk because it did not believe enough people had been injured or killed at that intersection to justify the expenditure.</p>
						
						<p>The state’s best settlement offer before trial was $100,000. The jury agreed that the crosswalk was a trap for pedestrians. It found that Chris could not have avoided the accident and was not to blame in any way. In a unanimous verdict, the jury awarded Chris’ family $9.5 million.</p>
